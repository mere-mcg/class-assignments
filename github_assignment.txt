This project from the LA Times Data Desk analyzes temporary visas granted to foreign agricultural workers in the United States Department of Labor via its H-2A program. To analyze the data, the LA Times imported a Python analysis tool and downloaded the data files from the U.S. Dept. of Labor's Office of Foreign Labor Certification. I'm not sure what a Python analysis tool is or does, but I think it sounds cool and is probably really helpful.They used a line "%%capture" to get the data and then they cleaned it. They ran a geo code to map work site locations. The code they wrote read the csv file and made groups by calendar year and summed the total number of certified workers. They used the an assignment operator: "annual_usa = df.groupby ("certification_start_year").agg(dict(workers_certified="sum")). They also graphed the data in a bar chart, which I thought was super cool. By doing all of this, they were able to tell that the total number of certified H2A visas is going up nationwide. They also grouped the data by state and year, which is how they figured out that California's total number of visas topped 11,000 last year. From here, they filtered down the data to just California's totals and calculated the percent change and found that if the hiring pace stays the same, the number will keep increasing. They took it a step further to analyze counties that had farms where workers are actually employed and mapped that data. They calculated that change in each county and then ranked them to find that counties on the central coast were driving the growth. They essentially did something similar to analyze crops and found that strawberries and lettuce crops have accounted for most of the new workers. The data and the analyzing of it was a significant part in the reporting process for this story. It was cool to see how it all unfolded.
